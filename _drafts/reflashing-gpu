# Re-flashing a soft-bricked Ampere GPU

Accidentally bricked your Legion's GPU after flashing a VBIOS? Don't worry, there's a way to make your laptop functional again. 
A soft-bricked GPU will display a black screen upon boot. To fix this, we will need to boot into safe-mode. 
Prepare a bootable USB with Windows Installation Media. 
Spam **F12** after powering on the laptop, you will be presented with a screen asking you to select a boot drive. 
Select your bootable USB and proceed with Windows Setup.
Press **Next.**

Select **Startup Settings** and press **Restart.** 
After restarting press **F4** to boot into safe mode. 
If Startup Settings isn't there, select **Command Prompt** and then type **bcdedit /set {default} safeboot minimal** into Command Prompt.

Exit Command Prompt and proceed to Windows. 
Use the attached NVFlash (patched for Ampere mobile) to re-flash your orginial VBIOS. 
This patched version bypasses all Board ID Mismatch errors. 
Open a Command Prompt as Administrator. 
**cd..** to the location of your NVFlash folder.
Run **nvflash_patched_ampere -6 "insert original VBIOS name.rom"**

This only works on Nvidia RTX 3000 series mobile GPUs.
